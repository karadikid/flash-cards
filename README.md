# Yoga Cards Flashcard Demonstration
- This card game tests one's knowledge of the twelve Sivananda asanas

# Purpose
This Website contains the framework for a future Yoga Web Application.  It illustrates using Cascading Stylesheets (CSS)Commit for functionality, eventually adding Javascript.

## Current Functionality
While viewing in the browser of your choice, best viewed in Chrome or Brave Desktop, click the individual cards to see the Asana description.  Advanced users can try to type the Asana name in the text box and click "Name that Asana" button.  Clicking "Advance Card" allows one to move forward through them.  If you cannot guess the answer, *inspect* the site for your answers!
